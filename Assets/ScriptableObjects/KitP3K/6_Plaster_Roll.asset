  KitDescText: Plaster rolls, commonly found in first aid kits, are versatile medical
    supplies used primarily for securing dressings and bandages in place. They are
    made of a porous fabric infused with adhesive, allowing them to adhere securely
    to the skin. When applied, plaster rolls provide support and compression, helping
    to immobilize injured limbs or secure wound dressings.
