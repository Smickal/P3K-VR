  KitDescText: 'Triangular bandages should be used to support a fracture or broken
    bone in the arm. Optimally, triangular bandages should be used in tandem with
    a splint. Using a splint will help ensure the bone deviates as little as possible
    so it is able to properly heal.

    Triangular bandages are bandages that are
    used to support a fracture or broken bone, typically in combination with a splint
    to help restrict the movement of the bone, promoting optimal healing.
